set x64 triplet as default

I myself agree it should default to x86 on 32-bit windows and x64 on 64-bit windows, but we would need to have the Visual Studio team make the same change to maintain the customer experience.
I set the default triplet using one or more of the provided methods:
set the environment variable VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET
from command prompt set VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET=x64-windows
from powershell prompt ${env:VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET} = "x64-windows"
add --triplet x64-windows to the command line
Example: \.vcpkg.exe install boost[core,mpi] --triplet x64-windows
concatenate :x64-windows after the port[features]
Example: .\vcpkg.exe install boost[core,mpi]:x64-windows
I myself have also created a series of powershell scripts using powershell core to maintain the various instances of vcpkg being used, triplet type needed, production or test environment, version of C/C++ ie Visual Studio, sets the various other vcpkg environment variables and or directory paths, etc.
